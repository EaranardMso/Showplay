# Showplay
This project is in the very early stages of development. There are no official releases yet, and there is no timeline for when official releases will become available.

## Our goal
Our goal is to create a free and open-source solution to setting up, organizing, and playing back sound queues for theatrical proformances. Our software will be easy to use and will include a portable solution for high-school students who do not have the ability to install software.

## Contributing
Right now this software is in the very early staages of development, so contributions will not be done through the standart chanels. I am however looking for more people to help out with the initial development, so if you are famillear with c# and WPF, and youre willing to deal with the fact that I'm very new to both c# and git, than please email me at earanardmso@protonmail.com. If not, thank's for yoru interest, and please check back once initial development is complete and I will be hapy too start accepting PR's.

## Installation
Thank you for your interest. Unfortunitely there are no official releases of showplay yet. I'm sorry.
